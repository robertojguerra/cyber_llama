Open source robotic llama

The CyberLlama project was started to help everyone in getting their own robotic pet, using more available materials and being esier to build than the other dogs, cats, spiders, etc.

I maximized the use of open source components, so that no body would have a barrier of entry and participate actively.

The mechanics are designed in FreeCAD, and the design is simple and easy to modify.

The control electronics is an arduino nano equivalent.

Embedded Linux is provided by an Orange Pi Zero Original or Orange Pi Zero 3, with Wifi for real time telemetry.

The electric power is provided by a 74 Watt-hour USB battery pack.

Each leg has 3 degrees of freedom. Right now, it has very poor Z (ground to hoof) height reach. I am going to chage the design to improve this, but everyone is welcome to send suggestions, napking sketches or FCStd files.

There will be a head with 2 degrees of and a mouth.

The joints are meant to be snap-click-together, and the use of glue or screws might be acceptable if it provides great advantages.

Eveybody with an interest in robotics, mechanics or circuits, is welcome to fork this project and continue development.
